# Odin Recipes 🍽️

The goal was to get hands-on practice with basic HTML by building a small recipe website.

## 📖 About the Project

**Odin Recipes** is a basic website that includes:

- A homepage (`index.html`) with links to different recipes
- Individual pages for each recipe
- Clean and simple HTML structure

Nothing fancy—just good old HTML to practice building websites from scratch.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
